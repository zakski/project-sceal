	<h3>Description:</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		tuProlog is a Java-based light-weight Prolog for Internet applications and infrastructures. 
		For this purpose, tuProlog is designed to feature some interesting qualities: it is easily deployable, 
		just requiring the presence of a Java VM and an invocation upon a single JAR file; 
		its core is both minimal, taking the form of a tiny Java object containing only the most essential properties
		 of a Prolog engine, and configurable, thanks to the loading and unloading of predicates,functors and operators embedded in libraries;
		 the integration between Prolog and Java is as wide, deep, clean as possible; finally, interoperability is developed along the two main 
		 lines of Internet standard patterns and coordination models.
