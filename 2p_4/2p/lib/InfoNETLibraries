The libraries ikvm-api.jar and mscorlib.jar are used in order to write java code that can 
load .NET assemblies when it is translated into an .exe with IKVM.NET (ikvmc).
In Java those libraries are used only at compile time to satisfy javac but they are not 
required at runtime because their use is conditioned from the fact that the code is executing 
on the .NET platform (System.getProperty("java.vm.name").equals("IKVM.NET") == true).

So: DON'T PUT ikvm-api.jar AND mscorlib.jar FILES IN THE JAVA RELEASE, THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED.
